# **FaceFUN Repository**

## **Overview**  

The **FaceFUN** project investigates how plant-associated fungi influence vegetation dynamics and ecosystem processes under global change factors, with a specific focus on **phosphorus-limited dry forest-grassland systems**. Research is conducted at **EucFACE (Eucalyptus Free-Air CO‚ÇÇ Enrichment)**, where vegetation shifts in response to **elevated CO‚ÇÇ (eCO‚ÇÇ)**are examined through a multi-scale approach combining **field-based sampling, controlled growth chamber experiments, environmental DNA (eDNA) and RNA (eRNA) analyses, and ecosystem process modeling (MODEX)** to assess plant-soil-microbe interactions under elevated CO‚ÇÇ

This repository serves as a workspace for storing datasets, developing and refining analysis scripts, visualizing results through figures and graphs, and maintaining version history throughout the project.

## **Repository Structure**  

### üìÇ **DATA**  
**`EucFACE_vegsurvey_consolidated_data.csv`** ‚Äì Vegetation survey dataset from EucFACE, providing species presence/absence data across rings, plots, quadrant and sampling cells.

**`Photosynthetic_Pathways_of_Plants_TERN_v2_19092024.csv`** ‚Äì Dataset from TERN (Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network), containing species-level classifications of photosynthetic pathways (C3/C4) along with other ecological traits.

**`TRY_Categorical_Traits_Lookup_Table_2012_03_17_TestRelease.xlsx`** ‚Äì Extract from the TRY Plant Trait Database, providing a wide range of plant functional traits, including growth form (herb, graminoid, fern).

**`veg_survey_lastdate.RData`** ‚Äì Last survey only subset of the EucFACE vegetation survey dataset.

### üìÇ **SCRIPTS**  
This folder originally held analysis scripts. Some example/early-analysis files (including a cell selection script and an example figure) were removed to keep the repository focused on core datasets. If you need those analyses restored, contact the project maintainer or check older commits in version control.
